- ‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless deployment on AWS Lambda

## Song Selection Algorithm

The application uses a sophisticated weighted random selection algorithm to pick songs for playlists, designed to surface both popular and lesser-known songs. Here's how it works:

1. **Song Categorization**
   - Songs are first divided into four categories:
     - Hololive Original Songs
     - Hololive Cover Songs
     - Holostars Original Songs
     - Holostars Cover Songs
   - Songs are identified as Holostars content if either the channel or any mentioned collaborators are from Holostars

2. **View-Based Sorting**
   - Within each category, songs are sorted by view count in descending order
   - This creates a ranking where index 0 is the most viewed song

3. **Weighted Random Selection**
   - Songs are picked using a weighted probability system based on their position:
     ```
     Top 10% of songs:    1x weight
     10-20% position:     2x weight
     20-30% position:     4x weight
     30-40% position:     8x weight
     40-50% position:    16x weight
     50-60% position:    32x weight
     60-70% position:    64x weight
     70-80% position:   128x weight
     80-90% position:   256x weight
     Bottom 10%:        512x weight
     ```
   - This exponential weighting gives less viewed songs a significantly higher chance of being selected
   - Each time a song is picked, it's removed from the pool to avoid duplicates

4. **Playlist Creation**
   - Up to 50 songs are selected for each category
   - Selected songs are added to their respective playlists
   - Playlists are cleared and recreated daily to ensure fresh content

This algorithm ensures that:
- Less popular songs get more exposure
- Popular songs still have a chance to be included
- Each category maintains its own selection pool
- The selection process is random but weighted towards discovering hidden gems
